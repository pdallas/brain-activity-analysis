# Before doing anything...

You should download the data yourself and extract them here.
The whole datasets are around 10 GB, so it may take a while to download them.
And that's why I've added them in gitignore. That means that they do not get tracked by git.
It is important to keep the data in the same folder structure as they are in the zip files 
because the code expects them to be in the same structure.

## How the directory should look like:

data\ -> __MACOSX

data\ -> Final Project data
